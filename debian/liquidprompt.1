.TH LIQUIDPROMPT 1 "May  7, 2015"
.SH NAME
liquidprompt \- A full-featured & carefully designed adaptive prompt for bash & zsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
Liquid Prompt gives you a nicely displayed prompt with useful information when you need it.
It shows you what you need when you need it.
You will notice what changes when it changes, saving time and frustration.
.br
You can even use it with your favorite shell â€“ \fBbash(1)\fP or \fBzsh(1)\fP.
.SH ACTIVATION
The liquidprompt package has no way to know which users do you want this prompt to be active for.
A small script, \fBliquidprompt_activate\fP is included to ease activation of the prompt.

This will set the required environment:
.sp 1
.nf
	* The files \fB~/.bashrc\fP and/or \fB~/.zshrc\fP are modified to load liquidprompt at startup.
	* If no previous \fB~/.config/liquidpromptrc\fP file exists, it will be created.
.fi
.sp 1
So, to get liquidprompt working simply run:
.sp 1
.nf
	user@debian:~$ liquidprompt_activate
	user@debian:~$ source ~/.bashrc
.fi

Be aware that multiple invocations of the \fBliquidprompt_activate\fP command
may pollute \fB~/.bashrc\fP and/or \fB~/.zshrc\fP files.

.SH FUNCTIONS
Once liquidprompt has been loaded, you will have 4 new commands available (which are shell functions actually).
.TP
.B liquidprompt_tag tag
tag current shell liquidprompt with \fItag\fP.

.B liquidprompt_OFF

.TP
.B liquidprompt_off
